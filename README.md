# JavaSQL

This package simplifies the coding process of using Java to interact with a SQL database.

The philosophy integrated into the code is that someone unfamiliar with SQL syntax should be able to use this package. Thus, all the method names use familiar Java semantics and adhere to common Java practices. Moreover, this package only contains calls to basic SQL commands. In other words, it is up to the programer to supply the logic, this package simply provides an easy-to-use SQL to Java interface.
